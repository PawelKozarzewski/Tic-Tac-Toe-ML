# Tic-Tac-Toe-ML
A Tic-Tac-Toe game with an agent that was trained with Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning).

## Training:
The agent learns while playing with itself.  
Running the _agent.py_ starts the training of the agent.  
All the values of the Q table are then saved in a file.

## Playing the game:
Before playing the game you need to download [appJar](http://appjar.info/Install/ "appJar") - a simple library that I used to make the GUI.  
After downloading, just unzip and put this folder into the same folder where the code is.

To play the game, launch _game.py_  
During the game, the ai will use the Q table that was previously generated during the training.
